# Data Analysis Process:
# Data Cleaning with Power Query:

Imported sales data from various branches into Power Query.
Cleaned and transformed the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

# Visualization with Power BI:

Created interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as total sales, gross income, customer demographics, and product performance.
Used slicers and filters to allow for dynamic exploration of data across different branches, cities, and product lines.

# Key Findings:
Sales Performance: Identified the top-performing branches and cities, with New York leading in total sales and gross income.
Customer Insights: Analyzed customer type and gender distribution to tailor marketing strategies.
Product Analysis: Highlighted the best-selling product lines and their impact on revenue.
Financial Analysis: Compared unit prices and quantities sold to understand pricing strategies and inventory management

# Critical Insight: February Deficit:
Discovered a significant deficit in February where the total cost exceeded the gross margin. This indicates that our expenses were higher than our profits for that month.
Action Plan: Delve deeper into Februaryâ€™s data to identify the root causes of this deficit and implement corrective measures to optimize costs and improve profitability.
